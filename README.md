## About the data

The data on which you are going to work are real data, they come from a retailer as well as from some banking organizations (FNCI and Banque de France). Each line represents a transaction carried out by check in a store of the sign somewhere in France, they are not raw and several variables are already created variables, i.e. are resulting from the feature engineering, we have a set of 23 variables which have the following meaning:  

- ZIBZIN: identifier relative to the person, i.e. it is his bank identifier (relative to the checkbook in use). 
- IDAvisAuthorisAtionCheque: identifier of the current transaction.

- CodeDecision : this is a variable which can take 4 values :  
    0 : the transaction has been accepted by the store.

    2 : the customer is part of a black list, his history indicates that he is a bad payer (outstanding payments or banking incidents in progress), his transaction is then automatically refused.
